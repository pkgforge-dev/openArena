## Description

OpenArena is a free and open source first-person shooter game based heavily on the Quake III Arena-style deathmatch. Score frags to win the game using a balanced set of weapons each designed for different situations. Guns include a chaingun, rocket launcher, shotgun, and railgun.

OpenArena's style of play is very fast and requires skill to be played successfully online. Gameplay modes include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Tournament, Capture the Flag, Elimination, CTF Elimination, Last Man Standing and Double Domination.

This version of OpenArena is based on the Quake3e engine. I do not take credit for the work done by the OpenArena team nor Eugene, who develops the Quake3e engine.

The OAX patch has been applied, which adds support for more screen resolutions and makes the game playable in modern systems. It also includes bugfixes and improvements. Connections to unpatched servers do work and present no issues.
